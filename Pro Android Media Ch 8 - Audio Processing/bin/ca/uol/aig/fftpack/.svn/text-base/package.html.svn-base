<p>A Java translation of fftpack by Baoshe Zhang.</p>

<p>jfftpack is a Java version of fftpack.  jfftpack is based
on Paul N. Swarztraubre's Fortran code and Pekka Janhuen's
C code.  It is developed as part of my official duties as
lead software engineer for
<a href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/ukatc/projects/scubatwo/">SCUBA-2 FTS projects</a>.</p>

<p>The original fftpack was public domain, so jfftpack is
public domain too. This software is in no way certified or 
guaranteed.</p>

<p>Please send any comments or bug reports to baoshe.zhang at
uleth.ca or baoshe_zhang at hotmail.com.</p>

<p>Notes:
Please read the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/fftpack/doc">documents
for FFT formula</p> if necessary.</p>
